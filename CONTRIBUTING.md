# Contributing to Visor

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Visor — Low Orbit Studio's shared design system. Whether you're fixing a bug, improving a component, or proposing a new token — contributions are welcome.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+
- npm (not bun, not pnpm)

### Set Up the Dev Environment

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/loworbit/visor.git
cd visor

# Install dependencies (root + all workspaces)
npm install

# Start the docs site locally
npm run docs:dev

# Run tests
npm test

# Type-check
npm run typecheck
```

```

**Distribution model:** Components are copy-and-own via the registry — consumers run `npx visor add <component>` and own the source. Tokens are distributed as the `@loworbitstudio/visor-core` npm package.

## Adding or Modifying Components

1. **Implement the component** in `components/ui/<component-name>/`.
2. **Register it** in `registry/registry-ui.ts` following the existing pattern.
3. **Write tests** in `components/__tests__/` using Vitest + React Testing Library.
4. **Document it** by adding an MDX page under `packages/docs/content/docs/components/`.
5. Run `npm test` and `npm run typecheck` before opening a PR.

### Component conventions

- Use **CSS Modules** for all styles — no Tailwind, no CSS-in-JS.
- Reference **CSS custom properties** exclusively — never hard-code color, spacing, or typography values. All tokens live in `@loworbitstudio/visor-core`.
- Use **CVA (class-variance-authority)** for component variants.
- Use **Radix UI primitives** only for components that require complex accessibility behavior (dialogs, dropdowns, etc.). Prefer plain HTML elements otherwise.
- Use **Phosphor Icons** (`@phosphor-icons/react`) for any icon needs.
- Components must be fully **theme-agnostic** — they should look correct under any theme class without modification.

## Adding or Modifying Tokens

Tokens live in `packages/tokens/src/` and follow a 3-tier architecture:

1. **Primitives** — Raw values (e.g., a specific hex color or a spacing step).
2. **Semantic** — Purpose-named tokens (e.g., `--text-primary`, `--surface-card`, `--border-default`).
3. **Adaptive** — Theme-aware tokens that resolve differently based on the active theme class.

When adding tokens:

- Add primitives first, then reference them in semantic tokens.
- Keep names purpose-driven, not value-driven (`--text-muted`, not `--gray-400`).
- If a token is theme-specific, add it to the relevant theme file rather than the base layer.
- Run `npm run build -w packages/tokens` to verify the package builds cleanly.

## Testing Expectations

- All components must have test coverage using **Vitest** and **React Testing Library**.
- Tests live alongside source in `components/__tests__/`.
- Run the full test suite with `npm test` before submitting a PR.
- Tests should cover rendering, key interactions, and any meaningful variant combinations.
- Aim for meaningful coverage — don't write tests just to check a box.

## Code Style

- **CSS Modules** for styles. No Tailwind, no inline styles, no CSS-in-JS.
- **TypeScript** throughout — no `any` unless truly unavoidable.
- **CVA** for variant management in components.
- **Named exports** preferred over default exports.
- Follow the patterns already established in existing components — consistency matters more than personal preference.

ESLint is configured at the root. Run `npm run lint` to check and `npm run lint:fix` to auto-fix.

## PR Process

1. Fork the repo and create a branch with a descriptive name (e.g., `feat/button-loading-state` or `fix/input-focus-ring`).
2. Make your changes — one concern per PR is strongly preferred.
3. Run `npm test`, `npm run typecheck`, and `npm run lint` before pushing.
4. Open a pull request against `main` with a clear title and description of what changed and why.
5. A maintainer will review and may request changes. We aim to respond within a few business days.

For significant changes — new components, breaking token changes, architecture decisions — please open an issue first to discuss the approach before investing time in implementation.

## Code of Conduct

Be respectful. This is a collaborative space and everyone is expected to engage constructively and with good faith. Harassment, dismissiveness, or bad-faith behavior will not be tolerated.
